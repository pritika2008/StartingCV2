# StartingCV2

This repository shows a list of coding projects I looked through while learning OpenCV and classic AI models when I was younger(early teen). These projects were inspired by "Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI" and served as an introduction to practical AI programming. My focus was on experimenting with pre-existing code to understand core concepts, techniques, and real-world applications of AI. These projects represent my first few baby steps in hands-on AI development.
