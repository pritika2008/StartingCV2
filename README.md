# Starting AI

This repository shows a list of coding projects I looked through while learning OpenCV and classic AI models when I was younger(early teen). These projects were inspired by "Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI", "freeCodeCamp", and "MIT HAN Lab" (I owe great thanks to them. They not only showed me the true capabilities of AI, but also gave great lessons on AI. I highly recommend watching their youtube channels to learn more about AI.) My focus was on experimenting with pre-existing code to understand core concepts, techniques, and real-world applications of AI. These projects represent my first few baby steps in hands-on AI development.
